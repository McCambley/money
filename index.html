    <h1>ðŸ’° Budgeting</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>The goal of this page is to act as a handy reference and approachable jumping off point for budgeting.</p>
      <p>
        There's a lot here so take your time, ask questions, and know that you don't have to do everything all at once.
        Everything I've written below I've learned from years of life on earth, and I'm still working on following this
        all myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're wondering, "What am I supposed to do with all this?", then skip to
        <a href="#to-do">the bottom</a> where you'll find a list of things to do next.

      <h2>Guidelines</h2>
      <h3>Cash <i>Checking and Savings</i></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Spend less than you make.</li>
        <li>Keep enough cash on hand for immediate expenses.</li>
        <li>Put whatever's left in high-yield savings accounts.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Investments <i>Stocks and Bonds</i></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Invest aggressively early, more conservatively later.</li>
        <li>Set it an forget it.</li>
        <li>Don't chase cheap thrills, follow the s&p 500.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Retirement <i>Long Term Investments, IRAs, and 401ks</i></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Put 20% of each paycheck aside for retirement.</li>
        <li>
          Max out yearly Roth IRA contributions ($6,000). You'll pay taxes when you deposit money (now) but none when
          you retire and pull that money out. You'll most likely be paying more in taxes later, so getting taxed on
          deposits now is ideal.
        </li>
        <li>Max out 401k contributions, especially if your company matches.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>General <i>Keeping it simple</i></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          50/30/20 â€” 20% of your income should go towards savings and retirement. More is fine; less may mean saving
          longer. 50% (maximum) should go toward necessities. 30% goes toward discretionary items.
        </li>
        <li>Take your time with this. A solid "set up" session and semiannual check ups are plenty.</li>
        <li>
          Percentages change as you age. Check out the image below to see a solid guideline on how much to save when.
