        sense.

      <h3>Cash <i>Checking and Savings</i></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Spend less than you make.</li>
        <li>Keep enough cash on hand for immediate expenses.</li>
        <li>Put whatever's left in high-yield savings accounts.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Investments <i>Stocks and Bonds</i></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Invest aggressively early, more conservatively later.</li>
        <li>Set it and forget it.</li>
        <li>Don't chase cheap thrills, follow the s&p 500.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Retirement <i>Long Term Investments, IRAs, and 401ks</i></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Put 20% of each paycheck aside for retirement.</li>
        <li>
          Max out yearly Roth IRA contributions ($6,000). You'll pay taxes when you deposit money (now) but none when
          you retire and pull that money out. You'll most likely be paying more in taxes later, so getting taxed on
          deposits now is ideal.
        </li>
        <li>Max out 401k contributions, especially if your company matches.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>General <i>Keeping it simple</i></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          50/30/20 ‚Äî 20% of your income should go towards savings and retirement. More is fine; less may mean saving
          longer. 50% (maximum) should go toward necessities. 30% goes toward discretionary items.
        </li>
        <li>Take your time with this. A solid "set up" session and semiannual check ups are plenty.</li>
        <li>
          Percentages change as you age. Check out the image below to see a solid guideline on how much to save when.

          Set up an account on <a href="https://mint.intuit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mint</a> or
          <a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monarch</a> to get useful
          insights into your spending and savings.
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can set up a budget here, linking any banking or investment account you possess, or use something like
              Google Sheets to estimate income and spending.
            </li>
            <li>The point of these tools is to make sure that things are generally trending in the right direction.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Set up an account on
          <a href="https://www.betterment.com/get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Betterment</a> to
          start investing.

              Betterment's bread and butter is goal oriented saving and automated investing. For me, that means that
              this jargon can turn into tangible life changes, like buying a house or getting a dog, while the
              automation takes the headache out of deciding how to invest my money.
            </li>
            <li>
              To keep things simple, take
              <a href="https://www.betterment.com/get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this quiz</a>
              to get started with a betterment account and let them help you get started. I would love to do this with
              you, as it might be daunting, and I might be able to provide context from my experience over time by
              showing you how I've set up my finances with Betterment.

            We can do these tasks together, or you can do this on your own. There's no need to do this all at once. The
            first and most important step is thinking about it. You're a star.
